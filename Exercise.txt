1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

Terminal is an advance feature only people with tech knowledgement know. I say that because with 
terminal would be similar to the way we look in the files for our folder and items we have stored in
our computers but in terminal you can't just  look through your file without know certain commands. 
There are alot of commands but the common one are "cd" which changes directory/folder. Then you would
call on  "ls" that displays a list of everything in the folder. 

2. What is the major difference between Git and Github?
Github is a online storage where you can got all your project. Git is a way to port files from 
computer and export to your repository when your done adding new code. Github is a server for alot of 
people. Git is only link from one person's computer.   

3. Why do we use Github?
We use github because when your in a team there's more than one person working on it. Teammates can 
folk the skeleton of the project and add their own code without missing up the orginal file. Github 
you can go to previous version if needed. Makes group projects easier to get it together.
